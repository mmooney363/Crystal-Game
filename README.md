# Unit-4-Game
This project is a math based game involving crystals.

The player will be given a random target number at the beginning of the game.
There are four crystals on the screen. By clicking on a crystal the player will be adding a specific amount of points to the total.
The game is won by matching the total points to the given number. The player loses if the total goes above the random number. 
The value of each crystal is hidden from the player until it is clicked.
Each time the game starts, the value of the crystals will change.

The project is web based and can be played in most web browsers.
